# PayU signature generation
Welcome to PayU signature generation script! ðŸŽ‰


  This script was created for making the PayU api integration process much easier
  and is based on the official documentation: https://developers.payulatam.com/latam/en/docs/integrations.html#authentication-signature
  
  Currently available for Colombian payment api.

  At the current version, is possible to generate new signatures based on MD5  and to update just the reference code in a current generated signature.
